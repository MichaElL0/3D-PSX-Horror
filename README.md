# Something in the woods
 SOMETHING IN THE WOODS is a short horror game that places you in the shoes of a Police Officer on a fateful night. While driving down a desolate road, exhaustion compels you to stop at an isolated gas station for a cup of coffee. However, as you step inside, you look at a board with dozens missing person posters and wonder who or what could have done this. An eerie silence pervades the gas station, devoid of any staff or customers. You need to find out where everyone has gone.
